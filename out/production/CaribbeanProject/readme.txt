Yes or no? Yes. Yes, Donna Gabai


/**********************************************************************
 *  Did you encounter any serious problems? If so, please describe.
 **********************************************************************/
Yes or no? Yes. It took us a while to implement the country cards and transportation
cards class but after that, it was fairly straight forward. Our main problems came about
because of the text file. We made some simple mistakes like spelling things incorrectly
and it took a while to realize that the problem wasn't the actual code.

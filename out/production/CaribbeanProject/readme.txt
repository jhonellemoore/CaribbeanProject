 10 Days in the Caribbean is a command-line game that takes the user through ten days in the region.
 It is modeled after the board game "10 Days in Africa". The main objective of the game is to design
 a trip throughout the Caribbean in 10 days by using different vehicles. The user can visit countries
 that are adjacent to each other using a boat, and they can visit countries of the same color using an airplane.
 Overall, the user must fill in the 10 spots in the cardholder with a journey that complies with all the rules
 of the game in order to win the game!
